### This is a Monte Carlo simulation written in Python for the math problems discussed here:

#### The solution here is a result from a couple of brainstorming session with my friends Albert and Todor. The code is developed by Albert

### Problem 1:
A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. The cards are turned up one by one until an ace appears. Is the next card - the one following the 1-st ace - more likely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs?

+ You need Python3 and the libraries numpy and pylab in order to run the program
+ run the program like this: `python3 problem1-alb.py`
+ The program just runs the simulation and shows the results with some interpretations. Some plots are visualized too

### Problem 2:
To be added
