#### The solution here is a result from a couple of brainstorming session with my friends Albert and Todor. The code is developed by Albert

### Problem 1:
+ You need Python3 and the libraries numpy and pylab in order to run the program
+ run the program like this: `python3 problem1-alb.py`
+ In addition, a normalized histogram from the performed MC calculations of the distribution together with the analytical probability distribution (line) of the position of appearance of the first ace are also shown. One can experiment with the number of MC calculations (ne in source code) to observe for how many numerical experiments the histogram visually converges with the probability distribution, this is an illustration of the law of large numbers.

### Problem 2:
To be added
