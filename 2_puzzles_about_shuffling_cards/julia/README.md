### Problem 1:
+ You need Julia and the library ArgParse in order to run the program
+ run the program like this: `julia problem1.jl [--help]`
+ Currently the program just runs the simulation and shows the results. You can also specify the number of experiments performed and the number of deal to perform with each experiment
+ The interpretation of the results needs to be developed with explanations and plots

### TODOs for problem 1:
- not sure if the random number generator used is good enough for simulations like this one?

### Problem 2:
To be added
