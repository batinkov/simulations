### This is a Monte Carlo simulation written in Julia for the math problems discussed here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=316GRjuKgT0

### Problem 1:
A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. The cards are turned up one by one until an ace appears. Is the next card - the one following the 1-st ace - more likely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs?

+ You need Julia and the library ArgParse in order to run the program
+ run the program like this: `julia problem1.jl [--help]`
+ Currently the program just runs the simulation and shows the results. You can also specify the number of experiments performed and the number of deal to perform with each experiment
+ The interpretation of the results needs to be developed with explanations and plots

### TODO:
- not sure if the random number generator used is good enough for simulations like this one?

### Problem 2:
To be added
