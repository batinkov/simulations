### This is a Monte Carlo simulation for the math problems discussed here:

+ The Python solution (in python-alb) is the most mature for the time being. It's slow but it has interpretations of the results
+ The Julia implementation is quite fast but it simply run the simulation and shows the results. It lacks results interpretation
+ The aux directory is a playground with some experiments we did

### Problem 1:
A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. The cards are turned up one by one until an ace appears. Is the next card - the one following the 1-st ace - more likely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs?

### Problem 2:
To be added
