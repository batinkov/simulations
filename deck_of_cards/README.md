### This is a Monte Carlo simulation for the math problems discussed here:

### Problem 1:
A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. The cards are turned up one by one until an ace appears. Is the next card - the one following the 1-st ace - more likely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs?

+ The Python implementation problem1.py runs much faster if you use PyPy instead of the reference CPython implementation

### Problem 2:
To be added
